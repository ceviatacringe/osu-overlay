# osu-overlay
Osu Flashlight/Hidden/EZ remover, AR changer, Fully external.

## Notes
A work in progress osu overlay, parses beatmap files into coordinates and timings, used to render hitcircles over a semi-transparent click-through window.
Work in progress. 

## Instructions
If you want to try it: Make sure osu is not on fullscreen, and set your display to 1080p.
It does not work on very old maps (2010ish) due to parsing errors
Have osu and your main browser opened
Follow the menu instructions, changed the constants in main.py if needed
Raw input enabled for better responsiveness, but not neccessary

## This is a learning experiment and work in progress
Maybe at a later date I will polish it up and upload it properly with a better tutorial and github page
