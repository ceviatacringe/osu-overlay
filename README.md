# osu-overlay
Osu Flashlight/Hidden/EZ remover, AR changer, Fully external.

A work in progress osu overlay, parses beatmap files into coordinates and timings, used to render hitcircles over a semi-transparent click-through window.
Work in progress. 

If you want to try it: Make sure osu is not on fullscreen, and set your display to 1080p.

It does not work on very old maps (2010ish) due to parsing errors

# This is a learning experiment
Maybe at a later date I will polish it up and make it more user friendly, with proper instructions.
